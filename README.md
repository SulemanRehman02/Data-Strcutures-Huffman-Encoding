# Data-Strcutures-Huffman-Encoding
This project's purpose is to build a data compression method. That is, we want to convey the same information in a smaller amount of space given particular data. We'll be concentrating on compressing text files for this project, so we'll need to first learn how computers internally represent text. Computers save information as a series of bytes. A byte is an eight-bit value that ranges from 0 to 255. We need a technique to assign each English letter, punctuation symbol, special character, and other characters to an eight-bit(a value from 0 to 255) sequence in order to represent English text. The ASCII encoding, as stated in the table below, is responsible for this mapping. Notice that ASCII only uses 128 out of the 256 possible values that a byte can store.
